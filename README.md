# Finsure--Medical-Emergency-Financial-Preparedness

## Problem Description:
Medical emergencies impose sudden and significant financial
burdens on families. Many individuals lack adequate insurance coverage, emergency
savings, or awareness of actual treatment costs. As a result, families are forced to
arrange funds through loans, asset sales, or delayed care. There is currently no
accessible tool that assesses a household’s financial preparedness for medical
emergencies by analyzing insurance coverage, savings, and potential healthcare
expenses. Middle-class families in India face a critical financial vulnerability: they earn
too much to qualify for government health schemes (Ayushman Bharat covers only those
earning <₹5L/year) but too little to afford comprehensive health insurance that covers
major medical emergencies.
